Used K-Means Clustering to develop a model that automates the detection of forged bank notes. Used publicly available data from openml for testing the model. Pre-processed the data in various steps like most significant feature selection and normalization. The final model was able to detect forged banknotes with â‰ˆ 88% accuracy using the various wavelet features from the images of the banknote.
